                    for that course at other campuses.

                  The evaluation of courses on this site is a guide,
                  and transferability of any given course is not
                  guaranteed until an official transfer credit evaluation
                  is completed. Specific course equivalencies
                  require review based upon the unique characteristics of
                  each college and university, and may
                  differ from one institution to another.
                  Be sure to contact an academic advisor as the
                  database is regularly updated and subject to change.
